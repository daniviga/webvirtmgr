## WebVirtMgr panel \(a fork by [daniviga](http://daniele.vigano.me)\)

### Introduction

This personal fork is based on the great **WebVirtMgr** made by [Anatoliy Guskov \(retspen\)](https://github.com/retspen/webvirtmgr). WebVirtMgr is a libvirt-based Web interface for managing virtual machines. It allows you to create and configure new domains, and adjust a domain's resource allocation. A VNC viewer presents a full graphical console to the guest domain. KVM is currently the only hypervisor supported.
